# process-media
Currently contains logic for parsing of Google Takeout photo exports, which I need to consolidate from multiple family members into one location for use (Shutterfly, digital photo frames, deduplication, first year videos, etc.). But will need to handle processing videos from our camcorder with stupid names, as well.
